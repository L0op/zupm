    "name": "ms5803 - I2C Barometric Pressure and Temperature Sensor",
    "description": "The MS5803-14BA is a new generation of high resolution pressure sensors with SPI and I2C bus interface. It is optimized for depth measurement systems with a water depth resolution of 1cm and below. The sensor module includes a high linear pressure sensor and an ultra low power 24 bit delta-sigma ADC with internal factory calibrated coefficients. It provides a precise digital 24 bit pressure and temperature value and different operation modes that allow the user to optimize for conversion speed and current consumption. A high resolution temperature output allows the implementation of a depth measurement systems and thermometer function without any additional sensor. The device is driven at 3.3vdc, and has a pressure range of between 0 and 14 Bar, and a temperature range of between -40 and +85C",
