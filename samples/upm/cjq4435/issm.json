        "description" : "UPM module for the CJQ4435 MOSFET. It was developed using the Grove MOSFET module, but could be used with any MOSFET. A MOSFET is like a switch, but it can switch much faster than a mechanical relay. Here, we implement support via MRAA pulse width modulation (PWM) functions. Note: available periods vary depending on the capabilities of your platform.",
