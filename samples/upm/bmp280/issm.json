        "description" : "The BMP280 is an absolute barometric pressure sensor especially designed for mobile applications. The sensor module is housed in an extremely compact 8-pin metal-lid LGA package with a footprint of only 2.0 * 2.5 mm2 and 0.95 mm package height. Its small dimensions and its low power consumption of 2.7 uA @1Hz allow the implementation in battery driven devices such as mobile phones, GPS modules or watches.\\n\\nAs the successor to the widely adopted BMP180, the BMP280 delivers high performance in all applications that require precise pressure measurement. The BMP280 operates at lower noise, supports new filter modes and an SPI interface within a footprint 63% smaller than the BMP180.",
