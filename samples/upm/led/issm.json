    "description": "UPM module for the LED (or other similar light-emitting diodes). An LED is a p-n junction semiconductor which emits light in response to voltage. The longer wire of an LED connects to the positive seat (anode); the shorter wire connects to the negative seat (cathode). The flat side of the bulb corresponds to the cathode, while the rounded side corresponds to the anode",
