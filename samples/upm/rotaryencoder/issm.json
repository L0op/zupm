        "description" : "UPM module for the Grove rotary encoder. This rotary encoder encodes a rotation signal into electronic pulses that can be used to measure rotation and direction. It is useful in cases where a rotary knob is required, but using a potentiometer is not desirable. A rotary encoder can turn a full 360 degrees without a stop and does not place a resistive load on the circuit, as is the case with a potentiometer. This module maintains a position that is incremented or decremented according to the rotation on the encoder",
