        "description" : "Basic UPM module for the Grove temperature sensor on analog. This sensor uses a NTC thermistor to measure ambient temperature. The conversion formula has been updated to work with versions 1.1 and 1.2 of the sensor. For the older v1.0 sensor you will have to specify R0 and B values when initializing the device. The range of this sensor is -40 to 125 C and accuracy is +/- 1.5 C",
