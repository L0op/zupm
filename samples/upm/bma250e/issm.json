    "description": "The BMA250E is a triaxial, low-g acceleration sensor with digital output for consumer applications. It allows measurements of acceleration in three perpendicular axes. An evaluation circuitry (ASIC) converts the output of a micromechanical acceleration-sensing structure (MEMS) that works according to the differential capacitance principle.",
