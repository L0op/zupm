Calibration instructions, taken and slightly reworded from the DFRobot wiki at: http://dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/PH_meter%28SKU:_SEN0161%29 1) Connect equipment: the pH electrode is connected to the BNC connector on the pH meter board, and then the pH meter board is connected to the analog port 0 of the controller. When the controller gets power, you will see the blue LED on board is on. 2) Put the pH electrode into the standard solution whose pH value is 7.00. Run the dfrph example and note the pH output value. Compare the value with 7.00, and calculate the difference. This is the value you should supply to the setOffset() method. 3) Put the pH electrode into the pH standard solution whose value is 4.00. Then wait about one minute, and adjust the potentiometer on the interface board. Let the value stabilise at around 4.00. At this time,the acidic calibration has been completed and you can measure the pH value of an acidic solution. 4) According to the linear characteristics of pH electrode itself, after the above calibration,you can directly measure the pH value of the alkaline solution. If you want to get better accuracy, you can recalibrate it. Alkaline calibration use the standard solution whose pH value is 9.18. Also adjust the potentiometer and let the value stabilise at around 9.18. After this calibration, you can measure the pH value of an alkaline solution",

The module does not provide any telemetry or status - it only accepts I2C commands for its various operations. This module was tested with version 1.3 of the I2C Motor Driver. For stepper operation, this driver can run in one of two modes - Mode 1, where this driver handles the stepping operation, and Mode 2, where this driver simply sends commands to the Motor Driver, and it handles the stepping operation. Mode2 requires updated (and working) firmware to be loaded onto the device. The default stepper operation mode is Mode1, which is generally more flexible and is supported on all firmware revisions.",

However it is possible to send the commands via threading and the performance of the library will be very good given a low CPU load. On a busy system though you will notice some jitter especially at higher speeds. It is possible to reduce this effect to some extent by using smoothing and/or microstepping on stepper drivers that support such features.",

It supports both analog distance measurement, and UART based temperature and distance measurements. This driver does not support PWM measurement mode. For UART operation, the only supported baud rate is 9600. In addition, you must ensure that the UART TX/RX pins are configured for TTL operation (the factory default) rather than RS232 operation, or permanent damage to your URM37 and/or MCU will result. On power up, the LED indicator will blink one long pulse, followed by one short pulse to indicate TTL operation.",

There is a schematic diagram on the SeeedStudio site (3/2015): http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/index.php?title=G1/2_Water_Flow_sensor However, be careful when wiring this up - the schematic appears to have a bug in it: the lower left connection of the signal line (yellow) to Vcc (red) should not be there. The sensor can work with this connection, but probably not for very long",
