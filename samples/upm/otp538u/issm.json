    "description": "UPM module for the OTP538U IR temperature sensor This module was tested with the Grove IR non-contact temperature sensor. The sensor provides 2 analog outputs: one for the thermistor that measures the ambient temperature, and the other for the thermopile that measures the object temperature. Much of the code depends on analyzing Seeed Studio* examples and the circuit design. As a result, there are several 'magic' numbers derived from their circuit design. These values are used by default.",
